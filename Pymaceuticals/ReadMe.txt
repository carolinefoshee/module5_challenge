I did not work with anyone on this assignment, though I used a few different sources to help:

- Box 3: Finding Duplicate Mice: ChatGPT
- Box 5: How to drop just one index value: https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-drop-rows-by-index/
- Box 6: How to get the number of unique Mouse IDs after making the mouse ID an index: ChatGPT 
- Box 16: How to get the last timepoints: ChatGPT 

Most of the code I gathered from class activities and examples.
